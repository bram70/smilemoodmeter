Smile mood meter
==============



This app explores the use of mobile devices as a means to detect emotion from the face. Inspired by the MIT Mood Meter Project (http://moodmeter.media.mit.edu/), this project will use smile and frown detection techniques, implemented as an app on a mobile device, to detect the basic emotion of a user in real time. The detected emotion will be broadcast to a global server and used to guide a visual display, in realtime. It is intended for use during live theatrical or musical performances and may be demonstrated at an exhibit at ImagineRIT 2014.
